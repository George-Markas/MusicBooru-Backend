# MusicBooru
MusicBooru is a web app for streaming music over the network. For now, only MPEG-4 AAC is supported
(transcoding to that format might be implemented).

**This project is still very much work in progress.** It was initially conceived for the "Special Topics
in Software Engineering" course.

> [!NOTE]  
> This is the backend portion of the app. The frontend can be found 
> [here](https://github.com/George-Markas/MusicBooru-Frontend).
